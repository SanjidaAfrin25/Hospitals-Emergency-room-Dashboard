🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – A Data-Driven Approach to ER Performance 📊

# 📌 Introduction (Hook)
"Did you know that long wait times in emergency rooms can impact patient satisfaction and hospital efficiency? 🚨

To address this, I developed a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard that provides key insights into patient flow, wait times, admissions, and departmental workload."

# 📌 Project Overview
🔹 Technologies Used: Excel(Power Query, Power Pivot,Pivot table)

# 🔍 Key Insights Covered in the Dashboard:
✅ Total Number of Patients
✅ Average Wait Time to See a Patient
✅ Patient Admission Status (Admitted/Not Admitted)
✅ Patient Age Distribution
✅ Gender Analysis
✅ Department Referrals
✅ Percentage of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes
# 📊 Process
I used Power query to Extract and Transform data, Power Pivot to Create relationship and Add DAX Formula then Pivot Tables to generate reports, AND Data Visualization techniques to create an interactive dashboard that helps hospitals optimize emergency room operations.

# 📌 Dataset Headings

✅Patient Id – Unique identifier for each patient
✅Patient Admission Date – Date of hospital visit
✅Patient First Initial – First letter of the patient’s name
✅Patient Last Name – Last name of the patient
✅Patient Gender – Male/Female/Other
✅Patient Age – Age of the patient
✅Patient Race – Ethnicity or racial background
✅Department Referral – Department where the patient was referred (e.g., Orthopedics, Cardiology)
✅Patient Admission Flag – Indicates if the patient was admitted (Yes/No)
✅Patient Satisfaction Score – Satisfaction rating (e.g., 1 to 5)
✅Patient Wait Time – Time (in minutes) before treatment

# 📌 Insights from the Dashboard

📌 51.35% of patients were admitted, while 48.65% were not
📌 Average wait time is 34.92 minutes – how can we reduce this? 🤔
📌 45% of patients experienced delays – suggesting a need for better resource management
📌 53% of patients were male, 47% female – gender-based healthcare analysis

# 📌 KPIs Tracked
✅ Admission vs. non-admission rate
✅ On-time vs. delayed patient handling
✅ Wait time trends and impact on satisfaction
✅ Age-group-wise patient distribution
✅ Department workload and efficiency
# 📌 Final Conclusion
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard provides a data-driven solution to improve ER efficiency, patient care, and hospital operations. By analyzing admission rates, wait times, patient demographics, and departmental referrals, this dashboard helps identify bottlenecks, optimize resources, and enhance patient satisfaction.
